Class projects from Spring 2022 
These projects are from when I was first learning to code in c++ at Cal State Fullerton

The code itself is stored in a .h file with the .cpp file simply calling it.
At this time I was not taught how files worked in c++ so I did not even realize this issue.
I was also using namespace.std
